  The Mechanical Team is responsible for the physical design and contstruction of the structural parts of the car. Mechanical members use 3D computer modeling tools to help design components and analyze the forces on each part. We take safety very seriously. The end result is a lightweight car which is structurally sound and capable of withstanding whatever the road throws at us.

  <div class = "business_summary">
   The Business Team is responsible for establishing professionalism and good public relations in the community. Shortly after the Formula Sun Grand Prix race in the summer of 2009, CalSol Business Team was established. The Business Team is primarily responsible for acquiring sponsorship, setting up an alumni network, and establishing publicity for CalSol.

  The Electrical Team, like its name suggests, is reponsible for all the electrical related issues and all the electronics. The electrical system contains many student-designed Printed Circuit Boards (PCB), and each circuit board is responsible for a specific task on the car - data collection, screen display, motor control, etc.
